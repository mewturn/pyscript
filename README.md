# PyScript Demo
## Github Pages
PyScript allows Python scripts to be executed in the browser, meaning no installation is necessary (no need to install Python and no need for `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`!). All you need is a browser which enables JavaScript. The rest will be handled by the relevant PyScript JS library.

This repository is hosted on Github Pages, and the demos can all be ran in the browser like a normal website. You can view some of the demos here: https://mewturn.github.io/pyscript

For more info, visit the official PyScript website: https://pyscript.net 

For other demos, visit the official PyScript examples: https://pyscript.net/examples/

Viewing a page's source code will allow you to look at the underlying Python code and its interaction with Javascript, HTML and CSS.
